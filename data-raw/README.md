This is the output data from soilwat. 
This was generated by Caitlin Andrews for our project using generic 
sagebrush steppe vegetation parameters and site specific soil parameters.
Weather data from the USDA Sheep Experiment Station was used as daily 
forcing data in the Soilwat simulations.  This data can only be opened
with Rsoilwat_31 which you have to get from soilwat github.
